Tyding Notes
-------------------
This is review of the original Data Set Codebook **features\_info.txt** and **features.txt**. Original **Train** and **Test** sets were combined together in one single set. Subject Id as well as Activity Id were added as the first two columns of new set. Activity Id is ket a numeric value to be interpreted as pr **activity\_labels.txt**.

'features.txt' wa used to create variable Labels for x_train and x_test. Labels were striped down of "-" "," "(" ")" "()" to simplify
x_train.txt and y_train.txt and subject_train.txt were mixed in single unit of observationrs
x_test.txt and y_test.txt and subject_test.txt were mixed in single unit of observationrs
bot sets were combined.
