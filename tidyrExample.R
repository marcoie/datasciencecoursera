# Repeat your calls to gather() and separate(), but this time
# use the %>% operator to chain the commands together without
# storing an intermediate result.
#
# If this is your first time seeing the %>% operator, check
# out ?chain, which will bring up the relevant documentation.
# You can also look at the Examples section at the bottom
# of ?gather and ?separate.
#
# The main idea is that the result to the left of %>%
# takes the place of the first argument of the function to
# the right. Therefore, you OMIT THE FIRST ARGUMENT to each
# function.

# Call gather() to gather the columns class1
# through class5 into a new variable called class.
# The 'key' should be class, and the 'value'
# should be grade.
#
# tidyr makes it easy to reference multiple adjacent
# columns with class1:class5, just like with sequences
# of numbers.
#
# Since each student is only enrolled in two of
# the five possible classes, there are lots of missing
# values (i.e. NAs). Use the argument na.rm = TRUE
# to omit these values from the final result.
#
# Remember that when you're using the %>% operator,
# the value to the left of it gets inserted as the
# first argument to the function on the right.
#
# Consult ?gather and/or ?chain if you get stuck.

# Accomplish the following three goals:
#
# 1. select() all columns that do NOT contain the word "total",
# since if we have the male and female data, we can always
# recreate the total count in a separate column, if we want it.
# Hint: Use the contains() function, which you'll
# find detailed in 'Special functions' section of ?select.
#
# 2. gather() all columns EXCEPT score_range, using
# key = part_sex and value = count.
#
# 3. separate() part_sex into two separate variables (columns),
# called "part" and "sex", respectively. You may need to check
# the 'Examples' section of ?separate to remember how the 'into'
# argument should be phrased.
#
# Append two more function calls to accomplish the following:
#
# 4. Use group_by() (from dplyr) to group the data by part and
# sex, in that order.
#
# 5. Use mutate to add two new columns, whose values will be
# automatically computed group-by-group:
#
#   * total = sum(count)
#   * prop = count / total
#
